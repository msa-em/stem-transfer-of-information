The contrast transfer function (CTF) is a well-known and well-documented topic in HRTEM, where it is akin to the object transfer function of visible light microscopy. 
Similarly, CTF is much reported for various phase retrieval techniques in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
The main difference being that in the STEM case it is not as trivial what the CTF is and how it is calculated, with multiple different definitions having been published. 
In its simplest definition, the CTF defines how well information at different spatial frequencies is transferred from the object to the final, reconstructed image. 
Still, some definitions multiply the CTF by the inverse error $\frac{\pi\vec{k}}{\sqrt{2}}, essentially expressing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
