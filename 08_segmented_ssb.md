While ptychography, including SSB, is typically utilised for pixelated detector datasets, segmented detectors also play an important role.
As was mentioned in the previous section, segmented detectors offer a negligible data read-out overhead, which allows for faster scanning and increased time-resolution for phase characterisation via multi-frame acquisition [@bekkevold_ultra-fast_2024].
For SSB, segmented detectors approximate the side-bands
