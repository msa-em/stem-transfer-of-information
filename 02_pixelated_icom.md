## To-Dos
- Introduce analytical iCOM CTF (complex-probe autocorrelation)
- Introduce test objects and CTF convolution
- Discuss Scherzer defocus being suboptimal for iCOM

Effect of various probe aberrations on the CTF for iCOM imaging with a pixelated detector.
The resulting CTF is shown on the left panel, with its radial average in the middle panel, and its effect on example weak phase objects on the right panel.
