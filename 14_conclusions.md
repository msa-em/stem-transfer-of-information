Phase retrieval methods play a key role in extracting useful information from BF datasets using both pixelated and segmented detectors.
In this work we have demonstrated an unbiased framework for comparing the best-case scenario CTF for various experimental conditions and detector geometries.
Using this framework, we confirm some previously demonstrated facts including that iCOM needs to be performed in-focus, and that tcBF and iterative ptychography CTFs exhibit "Thon-like" oscillations for defocused probes.
Additionally, investigations of segmented detector CTFs confirm how the geometry of the detector is reflected in the anisotropy of the CTF, causing information along some directions to be better resolved than others.

In general, the main observation is that more annular segments produce more isotropic CTFs, and more radial rings reduces overestimation errors.
In other words, more detector elements produce CTFs closer to the fully pixelated case CTFs for all the phase methods.
Still, even with fewer detector elements it is fully possible to achieve high quality phase reconstructions, which also allows for leveraging the faster scan speeds possible with non-pixelated detectors for temporal resolution in STEM.
