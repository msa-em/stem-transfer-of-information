## To-Dos
- Introduce need for numerical calculation
- Introduce white-noise object
- Discuss slow convergence of low spatial frequencies
- Discuss similarities between SSB CTF and early ptycho iterations CTF

Effect of various probe aberrations and iterations on the CTF for iterative ptychography with a pixelated detector.
The resulting CTF is shown on the left panel, with its radial average in the middle panel, and its effect on example weak phase objects on the right panel.
